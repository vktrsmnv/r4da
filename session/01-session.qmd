## Cheatsheet


There are many resources that can help you navigate data import, and this [cheatsheet](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/data-import.pdf) is one of them. It contains the main things you need to work with the functions we're using this week. You don't need all of the info in it, but it's a nice format for a quick reference.
