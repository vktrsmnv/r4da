## What will you learn in this class

- use the statistical programming language `R` for data wrangling and analysis
- translate your social science theory into a statistical model
- use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to build causal models and use them when building statistical models
- create meaningful visualizations to communicate insights from statistical analysis
- describe your analysis in research papers
- use Quarto (and RMarkdown) to write reproducible reports
- use `git` and GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Asking for Help

1. For software/installation questions: better come over during office hours
2. For `git`/`R`-related questions: 
  0. *Read* the error message. Often the message includes suggestions on how to resolve it.
  1. Before posting, make sure the most recent version of your work is on GitHub (I will be able to download that exact version and see the issue)
  2. Attach screen shots/error message when first writing the message
