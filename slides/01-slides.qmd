## What will you learn in this class

-   use the statistical programming language `R` for data wrangling and analysis
-   translate your social science theory into a statistical model
-   use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to build causal models and use them when building statistical models
-   create meaningful visualizations to communicate insights from statistical analysis
-   describe your analysis in research papers
-   use Quarto (and RMarkdown) to write reproducible reports
-   use `git` and GitHub for version control and collaboration


## What You Will Learn

simulation text!


DAG 



## Your Expectations


- Majority - no experience with R 
- Issues most confusing and unclear about empirical analysis 

> Choosing the right method of analysis (for the Research question) <br>
> To find the right variables <br>
> Being aware of the results and limitations <br>
> Translating concepts into variables for OLS

## Assessment and Grading {.smaller}

-   You need to show up and participate

-   You need to pass all homework problem sets

    -   Weekly problem sets with coding and technical writing tasks, due Tuesday 22:00
    -   First 2-3 are individual, then in groups of 2-3 students
    -   Solutions are posted, *you* are evaluating yourselves by Friday 22:00
    -   Evaluation is point-based, passing means \>50% points
    -   Deadlines are hard
    -   Bonus: student(s) with highest homework scores get(s) 0.3 improvement of the final course grade

## Final Paper: Data Analysis Project {.smaller}

-   You will get a dataset and a research question you could answer using it
-   You will need to apply the skills you learned in this class to answer the research question
-   The write-up should read like the results section of a research paper
-   You will have at least 10 days to complete the task, no late work accepted
-   *Preliminary* time frame: **December 6-December 20, 2023**
-   If you want to work on a paper of your own instead, talk to me before **November 15, 2023**

::: task
The final paper grade is 100% of your course grade

## Course Policies {.smaller}

`r icons::fontawesome("clock")` Deadlines are hard

`r icons::fontawesome("calendar-check")` Attendance is expected (as long as you're healthy!)

`r icons::fontawesome("cloud-upload-alt")` No recording during sessions or office hours

<!-- -   `r icons::fontawesome("robot")` Generative AI policy -->

`r icons::fontawesome("scroll")` Check syllabus & website for updates regularly

`r icons::fontawesome("envelope")` Check email/Slack regularly

`r icons::fontawesome("comment-dots")` [Feedback and suggestions welcome anytime](https://viktoriiasemenova.typeform.com/to/A8mIv5vG)

## Generative AI policy {.smaller}

You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:[^1]

[^1]: These guiding principles are based on [*Course Policies related to ChatGPT and other AI Tools*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WpCeTyiWCPQ9MNCsFeKMDQLSTsg1oKfNIH6MzoSFXqQ/preview) developed by Joel Gladd, Ph.D.

\(1\) *Cognitive dimension:* Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate---rather than hinder---learning.

\(2\) *Ethical dimension***:** Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.

-   **‚úÖ AI tools for code:** You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

-   **‚ùå AI tools for narrative:** Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.

## Communication & Help {.smaller}

<!-- - Use [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/unima-r4da-s23/discussions) in our GitHub class organisation  -->

-   Slack workspace is the primary forum for communication
    -   `#course-announcements`: deadline updates, task clarifications, schedule/topic changes, etc. (please react so I see it reached you :D)
    -   `#github-updates`: automated notifications when new material is uploaded on GitHub
    -   `#help`: place for your questions and issues (ask & answer if you can)
    -   `#random`: place for various data/stats things
    -   you can create *private* channels for your teams or DM me
-   Email me ([semenova\@uni-mannheim.de](mailto:semenova@uni-mannheim.de)) for private matters (e.g., illness, accommodations, etc.)
    -   Expect response within 48 hours Monday - Friday
-   Office hours on Monday/Wednesday 15:30-17:00 in A5, 6, B301 ([please schedule in advance](https://calendly.com/vktrsmnv/r4da))

## Asking for Help {.smaller}

1.  For software/installation questions: better come over during office hours
2.  For `git`/`R`-related questions:

-   *Read* the error message. Often the message includes suggestions on how to resolve it.
-   Before posting, make sure the most recent version of your work is on GitHub (I will be able to download that exact version and see the issue)
-   Attach screen shots/error message when first writing the message
-   Use formatting for code parts (easier copypaste + aesthetics)

## Tour: R and RStudio

## A short list (for now) of `R` essentials

-   Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r}
#| eval: false

do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

. . .

-   Packages are installed with the `install.packages()` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("package_name") # once per device
library(package_name) # once per session
```

## R essentials (continued)

-   Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r}
#| eval: false

dataframe$var_name
```

. . .

-   Object documentation can be accessed with `?`

```{r}
#| eval: false

?mean
```

[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

-   The **tidyverse** is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science
-   All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar

# Version Control

## Git and GitHub

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/git-logo.png){fig-alt="Git logo" fig-align="center" width="200"}

Git is a version control system, like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word but more powerful.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/github-logo.png){fig-alt="GitHub logo" fig-align="center" width="200"}

GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet, like Dropbox but much better.

-   GitHub organization for the course

-   All of your work and your membership (enrollment) in the organization is private

-   Each assignment is a private repo on GitHub, I distribute the assignments on GitHub and you submit them there

-   Feedback & solutions are also uploaded to your repos

::: task
Make your account **today** so I can distribute the first problem set to you. Use ILIAS login as a username so I can find you easily.

## GitHub Workflow

# Quarto

## Quarto

::: incremental
-   Fully reproducible reports -- each time you render the analysis is ran from the beginning
-   Code goes in chunks narrative goes outside of chunks
-   A visual editor for a familiar / Google docs-like editing experience
:::

## Tour: Quarto
