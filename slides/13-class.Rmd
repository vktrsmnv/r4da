You can't interpret coefficients when focused on causal inference because the focus is on the X, not the Y. In prediction world, where you want to look at the overall variance of Y, you can interpret each of the Xs while holding the others constant. When you care more about the X itself, though, the other covariates only serve to get that X as accurate as possible, not to explain the overall variation in Y

Yeah, but you have to discover weird situations. Like WWII submarine thing!
