When electoral safety is lower, candidates are more likely to respond to email from constituents.  -->\n<!-- 2. When electoral safety is lower, candidates are more likely to respond to email from constituents from same district.  -->\n\n1. Legislative candidates are more likely to respond to emails from same district.\n2. Legislative candidates are more likely to respond to emails from same district, especially when candidates' electoral safety is low.   \n\n## Data \n\n- Data from field experiment from 2015 election of the Swiss legislature\n- Random sample of 660 candidates across cantons and parties \n- Researchers randomized two conditions in the email:\n  - *in-* vs. *out-canton* \n  - *same* vs. *different party* to candidate   \n\n## Where To Start  \n\n- Get to know the dataset \n- Start with a DAG (what is the main relationship? what are the confounders? what is randomly assigned, what is not? what is observed, what is not?)\n- Choose your identification strategy\n- Decide on model specification; have one main model (potentially testing all hypotheses), use it to generate meaningful quantities \n- Present your results not only numerically but also graphically\n- If necessary/possible, try different approaches for identification/measure for key variables/etc. as robustness checks\n\n\n## Formal Stuff\n\n- No collaboration at this stage\n- If you have questions/get errors and Google can't handle them, ask *me*\n- **Deadline: June 13, 2023, 23:59** \n  - Please upload PDF *with signed statutory declaration* on ILIAS \n  - All material (including the `qmd` **and** rendered PDF) should be on GitHub by then, too. I should be able to render the same PDF with one click. \n- Please proofread. \n\n\n",
