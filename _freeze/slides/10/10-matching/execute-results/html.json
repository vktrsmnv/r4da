Why?\n-   Randomization solves many internal validity issues:\n    -   Selection: Treatment and control groups are comparable; people don't\n        self-select\n-   Goal: estimate ATE (average treatment effect)/CATE (conditional ATE)/ATT\n    (ATE on the Treated)\n-   Under randomization, ATE = ATT because the selection bias is zero\n\n## Matching Is A Way of Closing Backdoors\n\n\n```{dot}\n//| echo: false\n//| fig-width: 6\n//| fig-height: 4\n//| out-width: 100%\ndigraph D {\n  node [shape=circle];\n  edge [len = 1.2, arrowhead = vee];\n  a [label = \"X\"];\n  b [label = \"Y\"];\n  c [label = \"Z\"];\n  d [label = \"W\"];\n  \n  {rank=same a b};\n  {rank=same d c};\n  {rank=sink a};\n  a->b;\n  c->a;\n  c->b;\n  d->a;\n  d->b;\n}\n```\n\n\n. . .\n\n> Selecting a sample where people have similar levels of W (Z) is one way of\n> controlling for W (Z)\n\n## Why Matching?

Do something to guess or model the assignment to\ntreatment**\n\n0.  Hide the your main outcome variable for a while\n1.  Pick a set of variables (confounders) to match on, i.e. *matching variables*\n2.  Separate out the treated and untreated cases\n3.  For each treated observation, check how \"close\" each untreated observation\n    is on the matching variables and select the closest one (or few)\n\n**Step 2: Estimation. Use the new trimmed/preprocessed data to build a model and\ncalculate the effects**\n\n4.  Go back to the main model and compare the average treated outcome vs. the\n    average untreated outcome\n\n**Matching methods differ in how they deal with steps 3 and 4.**\n\n# Various Matching Methods\n\n## Example for Two Counfounders\n\n\n```{dot}\n//| echo: false\n//| fig-width: 6\n//| fig-height: 4\n//| out-width: 100%\ndigraph D {\n  node [shape=oval];\n  edge [len = 1.2, arrowhead = vee];\n  a [label = \"Treatment\"];\n  b [label = \"Outcome\"];\n  c [label = \"Education\"];\n  d [label = \"Age\"];\n  \n  {rank=same a b};\n  {rank=same d c};\n  {rank=sink a};\n  a->b;\n  c->a;\n  c->b;\n  d->a;\n  d->b;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Exact Matching {.smaller}\n\n1.  **Preprocessing step**\n\n-   Choose matches for treated units that have the *same* value in each $X$\n-   Discard all unmatched control units\n\n2.  **Estimation step**\n\n-   Calculate the effect of interest\n\n::: task\n-   Straightforward process\n-   No matching bias introduced\n-   Not feasible with high-dimesional or continuous data\n-   Strongly reduces the number of units if works\n:::\n\n## Exact Matching: No Observations Matched {.smaller}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10-matching_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Coarsened Exact Matching {.smaller}\n\n1.  **Preprocessing step**\n\n-   Discretize and group covariates into substantively meaningful bins\n-   Exact match on these bins ⇝ accounts for interactions\n-   Have to drop treated units in bins with no controls (lack of overlap) ⇝\n    changes estimand\n-   Allows you to control bias/variance trade-off through coarsening\n\n2.  **Estimation step**\n\n-   Calculate the effect of interest (ATE, ATT, ATC)\n-   Weight the untreated observations so each treated observation is matched to\n    the same number of untreated ones\n\n::: task\n-   Allows to control the amount of imbalance up front by setting the degree of\n    the coarsening: coarser means more imbalance, fineness means less imbalance\n    but also fewer matched units\n-   Can still break down in high dimensional datasets\n:::\n\n## Coarsened Exact Matching Results {.smaller}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10-matching_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-align='center' width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Nearest Neighbor Matching {.smaller}\n\n1.  **Preprocessing step**\n\n-   Find untreated observations that are very close/similar to treated\n    observations based on confounders\n-   We can define closeness using *lower-dimensional* distance metrics, i.e. we\n    reduce dimensionality in confounders\n-   Many different way to calculate the distance, e.g. propensity score,\n    Euclidean, or Mahalanobis distance (accounts for covariances between\n    variables)\n\n2.  **Estimation step**\n\n-   Calculate the effect of interest on matched dataset\n\n::: task\n-   Order of the matching matters in terms of which units get matched to which\n    other units (when matching without replacement)\n:::\n\n## Distance Measures {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n#### Euclidean distance\n\nFor observations $X_1$ and $X_2$ with $K$ number of matching variables:\n\n$$\nd(X_1,X_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^K(X_{1k} -

  Lower reduces bias (only use the closest matches)\n    -   Lower increases variance\n    -   ATT is easy to calculate with 1:1 exact matches on the treated units\n    -   If number of control units varies by treated unit, need to weight\n        observations to ensure balance\n-   **With or without replacement:** same control matched to multiple treated?\n    -   With replacement gives better matches & matching order doesn't matter\n    -   Without replacement simplifies variance estimation\n-   **Caliper:** drop poor matches?\n    -   Only keep matches below an arbitrary distance threshold\n    -   Reduces imbalance, but if you drop treated units, estimand changes from\n        ATT (ATE)\n\n# Inverse Probability Weighting\n\n## Weighting {.smaller}\n\n> Weighting for surveys: down-weight over-sampled respondents\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|           | Young | Middle | Old |\n|:----------|:-----:|:------:|:---:|\n|Population |  30%  |  40%   | 30% |\n|Sample     |  60%  |  30%   | 10% |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|           |       Young        |        Middle        |       Old        |\n|:----------|:------------------:|:--------------------:|:----------------:|\n|Population |        30%         |         40%          |       30%        |\n|Sample     |        60%         |         30%          |       10%        |\n|Weight     | 30 / 60<br>**0.5** | 40 / 30<br>**1.333** | 30 / 10<br>**3** |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Multiply weights by average values (or use in regression) to adjust for\n    importance\n\n## Propensity Scores {.smaller}\n\n1.  **Preprocessing step:**\n\n-   Predict the probability of assignment to treatment using a model (e.g. with\n    logit).
