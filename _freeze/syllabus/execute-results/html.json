Later in the semester we'll turn to the powerful toolbox of causal inference approaches, but continue to keep the focus on data as we do so. -->\n\n\n<!-- This class will expose you to [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)—one of the most popular, sought-after, and in-demand statistical programming languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you'll learn in this class, you'll know enough to be able to find how to analyze data-based questions in the future.   -->\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- ## Important pep talk! -->\n\n<!-- I *promise* you can succeed in this class. -->\n\n<!-- Learning R can be difficult at first—it's like learning a new language, just like French or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you'll be using like `ggplot2`—[made this wise observation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/): -->\n\n<!-- > It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. -->\n\n<!-- Even experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you're finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc. -->\n\n<!-- ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=\"80%\", fig.align=\"center\"} -->\n<!-- # https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1213275783675822080 -->\n<!-- knitr::include_graphics(\"/files/img/syllabus/hosrt_error_tweet.png\", error = FALSE) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- [![Alison Horst: Gator error](/files/img/syllabus/gator_error.jpg)](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1213275783675822080) -->\n\n\n## Course materials\n\nThere is no single textbook for this class, and I will be assigning chapters from various books. All of the material will be available to you for via this website. Due to copyright reasons, some of the links will be password-protected. I will tell you the password in class and in our Slack workspace. \n\nThere will be both required and suggested material. While required ones I expect everyone to be familiar with, the suggested ones are there in case you want to dive deeper into a particular topic. \n\n### Books & Videos\n\nFor general intro to R, we will primarily use the books listed below. Most of the time these would be suggested rather than required readings:\n\n- Garret Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)\n- Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim. [*Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R*](https://moderndive.com)\n\nThere are multiple good books published recently on the topic of causal inference. One of the books you will read a lot from was written by an economist Nick Huntington-Klein:\n\n- Nick Huntington-Klein. *The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality* (CRC Press, 2021), <https://theeffectbook.net/>. \n\nThe book is quite lengthy but worry not, it is written at a more general, easy-to-understand level with relatively minimal math. *You do not need to understand all the equations and notation.* Another bonus with this book is the YouTube videos available for each chapter. They are no substitutes of the book but will be a great place to start to speed up the reading. \n\nThere are a few more books I would assign chapters from and would recommend if you'd prefer a different take for some reason. \n\n- Ethan Bueno de Mesquita and Anthony Fowler. *Thinking Clearly with Data: A Guide to Quantitative Reasoning and Analysis* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2021). \n- Scott Cunningham. *Causal Inference: The Mixtape* (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2021), <https://mixtape.scunning.com/>. [**Also free(!)**](https://mixtape.scunning.com/). \n- Joshua D. Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke. *Mastering ’Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2015). \n\n*Thinking Clearly with Data* is an introductory book for quantitative methods, with an emphasis on reserach design and causal inference tools. We will read excerpts from it during the course. \n*The Mixtape* is a more detailed and mathier approach to these causal inference methods, while *'Metrics Matter* is a fairly canonical (and accessible!) book in the world of econometrics. \n\nFor the topic of data visualization, we will rely on various sources:\n\n- Kieran Healy. *Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2018), <http://socviz.co/>.\n- Claus O. Wilke. *Fundamentals of Data Visualization.* (O’Reilly Media, 2019), <https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/>.\n- Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen. *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis*. (in progress) 3rd edition. Springer, 2021. <https://ggplot2-book.org/>.\n\nAll assigned chapters and links to the resources you will need to prepare for our weekly sessions will be included on the reading page for that week. \n\n### R, RStudio, git, and GitHub\n\nWe will learn data analysis by *doing* data analysis. We will use the open-source (and free!) statistical programming language called [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/). `R` is very popular in data science and statistics, it makes beautiful graphics, and it is great fun. You will use [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\n\nTo make our workflow with R more efficient, we will also be using a version control tool called `git` and its online hosting Github. In a nutshell, think of this as Google Docs, but for code and on steroids. We will use Github to distribute material for our sessions, hand out and collect homework assignments, and provide you with feedback on your homework, too. \n\nYou can [find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and git here.](/resource/install.html)\n\n## Getting Help\n\nMost of you will need help at some point and I want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help. Having sad that, programming-related issues deserve a special mention: I encourage you to try searching for an answer online on your own first. The reason for this is that learning to google R and `git` errors _efficiently_ is an essential skill for anyone who codes, and you should try to learn it as early as possible.\n\n### Classes\n\nIf you have a question during the class, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\n\n\n### Office hours\n\nIf for whatever reason you'd rather come and talk in person rather than post on Slack, you can do this during the office hours. Considering the deadline for homework in on Monday, I will make sure to keep the slot on Friday, 15:00-17:00, for the office hours. This is, however, not the only time I am available. You can always just [pick from the time slots that work for me](https://calendly.com/vktrsmnv/data-s23) on that particular week and come at a different day/time. You can come in groups if you want. Just note that you'll need to let me know you're coming at least 6 hours in advance. \n\n### Slack workspace \n\nHave a question that can't wait for office hours? Prefer to write out your question in detail rather than asking in person? Our class workspace at [Slack](https://data-s23.slack.com) is the best venue for these. Once you are registered to the class via Portal2, you will get an email with an invite link. The `#help` channel would be the place to post your questions. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts in the channel before adding a new one. If you know the answer to a question that is posted, I encourage you to respond! \n\n### Email\n\nPlease refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go to Slack), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g., illness, accommodations, etc.). For such matters, you may email me at [semenova@uni-mannheim.de](mailto:semenova@uni-mannheim.de?subject=data-s23 // Your subject). You can also DM me in Slack. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to emails within 24 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.\n\n### Accessibility and Accommodations\n\nIt is my goal that this class is an accessible and welcoming experience for all students, including those with disabilities that may impact learning in this class. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options. After registration, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion. Further info on this topic is available at the [University's website](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/academics/advice-and-services/advice-for-students-with-disabilities-or-chronic-illnesses/). \n\n### Online Resources for R\n\nComputer programming can be frustrating because computers are stupid, and error messages are not always helpful. Fortunately, help is out there.  [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a Q&A site dedicated to helping people with their programming problems. [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is a similar concept, but tailored for people using RStudio (which applies to us). If you see these websites when you are googling your errors, these would quite likely contain some helpful info.  \n\nSearching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is basically a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for \"r scatterplot\", but if it does struggle, try searching for \"rstats\" instead (e.g. \"rstats scatterplot\").\n\n\n## Your Feedback\n\nOnce we are halfway through the class, I will ask you for some feedback regarding the class. We will discuss your responses and I will try to incorporate this feedback for the second part of the class. At the end of the course, you will receive the official evaluations administered by the University, and I would appreciate you filling those in. \nApart from these opportunities, you are always welcome to share your concerns or feedback any time during the course, in person during office hours or anonymously via the [pop-up form on the course website](https://viktoriiasemenova.typeform.com/to/A8mIv5vG). \n\n## Course structure\n\n### In-person classes\n\nWe meet weekly from 12:00–13:30 on Tuesdays in C217 in A5, 6. There are *no PCs* in the room so if you want to follow along during the labs (which I encourage you to do), you will need to bring a laptop. Alternatively, you could work from a tablet with a [cloud version of Rstudio](/resource/install.html#cloud-version-of-rstudio), but this would be less convenient. \n\nI expect you to come to the sessions prepared, which means having completed everything that is listed for the respective week in [Prepare](/prepare/) section of the website. We will have a short lecture-part and then we will move along to code-along part and other activities. \n\n### Weekly Homework Assignments\n\nThe only way to earn programming is through practice, which means you will have coding homework assignments. These problem sets will not be long but will be frequent, so you will need to do them weekly. While your first few assignments will be individual because I want to ensure that everyone gets comfortable with the workflow, as we progress during the semester, we will switch to group assignments. You will need to work in groups of 2-3 students, as this way you will learn more about the collaborative part of working with `git`. I will let you know more about this as the semester goes. \n\nI will distribute homework assignments via Github after our sessions on Tuesday. You will have until next Monday, 12:00 (noon) to complete the problem set. You will need to upload your latest solutions to GitHub by the deadline (this will be called to `push`), and I will evaluate the latest version that is available on GitHub on Mondays 12:00. I will try to grade problem sets the same day and provide you with feedback by our session on Tuesday (but let's see how this goes). \n\nContent-wise, the problem sets will be primarily coding tasks, but they will also include theoretical questions related to readings and \"lectures\" once in a while. In order to pass the assignment, I need to see that you have tried to solve every task, and most of the tasks should be completed correctly. \n\n## Attendance and participation\n\nAttendance and participation are important to your success in this course. You're expected to come to class each Tuesday prepared—having read the material and watched the videos—and ready to discuss the content and work with R. \n\nHowever, if you are sick, please just let me know you're not coming if you can (so I can adjust the activities in class if needed) and stay home. \n\nSince active participation is listed as a coursework requirement, I will take attendance at some point during the class. \n\n\n## Course policies\n\n**Be nice. Be honest. Don't cheat.**\n\n\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the semester. Deviations may become necessary as the semester progresses.\n\n\n### Late work\n\nYou will lose 1 point per day for each day a problem set is late. This is designed to not be a huge penalty (3 days late = 27/30 points on a problem set that gets a ✓), but instead is a commitment device to help you stay on schedule.\n\n### Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS)\n\nLife at GSU can be complicated and challenging (especially during a pandemic!). You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. [Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS)](https://education.gsu.edu/cps/) provides free, *confidential* support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The CPS office is staffed by professional psychologists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact CPS for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n\n### Basic needs security\n\n\n\n### Academic honesty\n\nViolation of [GSU's Policy on Academic Honesty](https://deanofstudents.gsu.edu/faculty-staff-resources/academic-honesty/) will result in an F in the course and possible disciplinary action.[^cheat] All violations will be formally reported to the Dean of Students.\n\n[^cheat]: So seriously, just don't cheat or plagiarize!\n\n### Special needs\n\nStudents who wish to request accommodation for a disability may do so by registering with the [Office of Disability Services](https://disability.gsu.edu/). Students may only be accommodated upon issuance by the Office of Disability Services of a signed [Accommodation Plan](https://disability.gsu.edu/services/how-to-register/) and are responsible for providing a copy of that plan to instructors of all classes in which accommodations are sought.\n\nStudents with special needs should then make an appointment with me during the first week of class to discuss any accommodations that need to be made.\n\n\n## Grading policy\n\nGrades for this class are intended to assess your learning about (1) data and code, (2) scientific and critical reasoning, and (3) statistical reasoning. Following university regulations, **100% of your grade will be determined by a final paper**. Make sure to sign up for the examination via Portal2 in addition to registering for the class during the semester (otherwise, I cannot submit your grade).\n\nI will only evaluate the final papers if you pass all the course requirements during the lecture period. This means two things.\n\n\n#### Active Participation \n\nShould you miss more than two classes, it is your responsibility to reach out to me in advance so we can agree on the way to compensate for the the missing session. You might ask you to do a short presentation in class or prepare a short text on a relevant topic for the class website. \n\n#### Homework assignments\n\nYou need to pass all of the homework assignments.\nPlease note that handing in the assignment is **necessary but not sufficient** for passing. Should the homework be below the standard of passing, I will ask you to resubmit that assignment but no more than twice during the semester[^failing]. \nFor group assignments, I measure each student's contribution with commits they made to the homework repository. \n\n\n\n\n[^failing]: I noticed some students like to use this option to get extra time to submit the assignments and for the sake of equanimity, I want to discourage this behavior.\n\n\n<!-- You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the [assignments page](/assignment/). -->\n\n\n\n<!-- ```{r assignments-grades, include=FALSE} -->\n<!-- assignments <- tribble( -->\n<!--   ~Points,   ~Assignment, -->\n<!--   14 * 10,   \"Weekly check-ins (14 × 10)\", -->\n<!--   9 * 30,    \"Problem sets (9 × 30)\", -->\n<!--   4 * 30,    \"Evaluation assignments (4 × 30)\", -->\n<!--   100,       \"Exam 1\", -->\n<!--   100,       \"Exam 2\", -->\n<!--   200,       \"Final project\" -->\n<!-- ) %>% -->\n<!--   mutate(Percent = Points / sum(Points), -->\n<!--          Percent = scales::percent(Percent)) -->\n\n<!-- grading <- tribble( -->\n<!--   ~Grade, ~Range, ~Grade1, ~Range1, -->\n<!--   \"1.0\",  \"95–100%\", \"3.0\",  \"73–76%\", -->\n<!--   \"1.3\", \"90–94%\", \"3.3\", \"70–72%\", -->\n<!--   \"1.7\", \"85–89%\", \"3.7\", \"67–69%\", -->\n<!--   \"2.0\",  \"80–84%\", \"4.0\",  \"63–66%\", -->\n<!--   \"2.3\", \"75–79%\", \"5.0\", \"< 50%\", -->\n<!--   \"2.7\", \"70–74%\",  -->\n<!-- ) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- <div class=\"centered-table\"> -->\n\n<!-- ```{r show-assignments-table, echo=FALSE, results=\"asis\"} -->\n<!-- assignments_total <- tibble(Assignment = \"Total\", -->\n<!--                             Points = sum(assignments$Points), -->\n<!--                             Percent = NA) -->\n\n<!-- bind_rows(assignments, assignments_total) %>% -->\n<!--   select(Assignment, Points, Percent) %>% -->\n<!--   pandoc.table(justify = \"lcc\", missing = \"—\") -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n<!-- </div> -->\n\n<!-- <div class=\"centered-table\"> -->\n\n<!-- ```{r show-grades-table, echo=FALSE, results=\"asis\"} -->\n<!-- grading %>% -->\n<!--   pandoc.table(justify = \"lclc\", -->\n<!--                col.names = c(\"Grade\", \"Range\", \"Grade\", \"Range\")) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- <div> -->\n\n\n## Friends\n\nOnce you have read this entire syllabus and [the assignments page](/assignment/), please DM me on Slack a picture of a Friends TV show character.[^friends] Brownie points if it's animated.\n\n[^friends]: Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, Joe... \n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/j4q4h9uWKWwnYT1k3Z/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Baby Yoda with IG-11\">\n</figure>\n",
