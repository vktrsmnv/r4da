In this class, we will talk about how social scientists identify causal effects (how X causes Y to happen) without experiments, what challenges this task poses, and how these problems are conceptually addressed. You will learn to implement different causal methods using R statistical programming language. Besides this, we will devote attention to effective data visualization, making you a more confident consumer and communicator of insights from your data.\n\n<!-- No statistical or computing background is necessary to succeed in this class, although you will benefit from the course most if you have taken an introductory class in quantitative methodology. You will learn to use the open-source and free statistical programming language R—one of the most popular, sought-after, and in-demand statistical programming languages, along with other professional tools for data analysis, such as RStudio, git, and GitHub. -->\n\n## Learning objectives \n\nBy the end of this course, you'll be able to:\n\n- use the statistical programming language `R` for data wrangling and analysis \n- translate your theory into a statistical model\n- outline theories with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)  \n- use statistical modeling for estimating *causal* effects from observational data  \n- create meaningful visualizations to communicate insights from data\n- use Quarto to write reproducible reports\n- use `git` and GitHub for version control and collaboration\n\n\n<!-- ## Important pep talk! -->\n\n<!-- I *promise* you can succeed in this class. -->\n\n<!-- Learning R can be difficult at first—it's like learning a new language, just like French or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you'll be using like `ggplot2`—[made this wise observation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/): -->\n\n<!-- > It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. -->\n\n<!-- Even experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you're finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc. -->\n\n<!-- ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=\"80%\", fig.align=\"center\"} -->\n<!-- # https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1213275783675822080 -->\n<!-- knitr::include_graphics(\"/files/img/syllabus/hosrt_error_tweet.png\", error = FALSE) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- [![Alison Horst: Gator error](/files/img/syllabus/gator_error.jpg)](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1213275783675822080) -->\n\n\n## Course materials\n\nThere is no single textbook for this class, and I will be assigning chapters from various resources. All of the material will be available to you for via this website. Due to copyright reasons, some of the links will be password-protected. I will tell you the password in class and will send via email at the beginning of the semester. \n\nThere will be both required and suggested material. While required ones I expect everyone to be familiar with, the suggested ones are there in case you want to dive deeper into a particular topic. \n\n### Books & Videos\n\nFor general intro to `R`, we will primarily use the books listed below. Most of the time these would be suggested rather than required readings:\n\n- Garret Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)\n- Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim. [*Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R*](https://moderndive.com)\n\nThere are multiple good books published recently on the topic of causal inference. One of the books you will read a lot from was written by an economist Nick Huntington-Klein:\n\n- Nick Huntington-Klein. *The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality* (CRC Press, 2021), <https://theeffectbook.net/>. \n\nThe book is quite lengthy but worry not, it is written at a general, easy-to-understand level with relatively minimal math. *You do not need to understand all the equations and notation.* Another bonus with this book is the YouTube videos available for each chapter. They are no substitutes of the book but will be a great place to start to speed up the reading. \n\nThere are a few more books I would assign chapters from and would recommend if you'd prefer a different take for some reason. \n\n- Ethan Bueno de Mesquita and Anthony Fowler. *Thinking Clearly with Data: A Guide to Quantitative Reasoning and Analysis* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2021). \n- Scott Cunningham. *Causal Inference: The Mixtape* (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2021), <https://mixtape.scunning.com/>. \n- Joshua D. Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke. *Mastering ’Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2015). \n\n*Thinking Clearly with Data* is an introductory book for quantitative methods, with an emphasis on reserach design and causal inference tools. We will read excerpts from it during the course. \n*The Mixtape* is a more detailed and mathier approach to these causal inference methods, while *'Metrics Matter* is a fairly canonical (and accessible!) book in the world of econometrics. \n\nFor the topic of data visualization, we will rely on various sources:\n\n- Kieran Healy. *Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2018), <http://socviz.co/>.\n- Claus O. Wilke. *Fundamentals of Data Visualization.* (O’Reilly Media, 2019), <https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/>.\n- Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen. *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis*. (in progress) 3rd edition. Springer, 2021. <https://ggplot2-book.org/>.\n\nAll assigned chapters and links to the resources you will need to prepare for our weekly sessions will be included on the reading page for that week. \n\n### Software \n\nWe will learn data analysis by *doing* data analysis. We will use the open-source (and free!) statistical programming language called [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/). `R` is very popular in data science and statistics, it makes beautiful graphics, and it is great fun. You will use [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) as the main program to access R. Think of `R` as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running `R` code.\n\nTo make our workflow with `R` more efficient, we will also be using a version control tool called `git` and its online hosting GitHub. In a nutshell, think of this as Google Docs, but for code and on steroids. I will use GitHub to distribute material for our sessions, hand out and collect homework assignments, and provide you with feedback on your homework, too. \n\nYou can [find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and git here.](/resource/install.html)\n\n## Getting Help\n\nMost of you will need help at some point and I want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help when you need it. Programming-related issues deserve a special mention: I encourage you to try searching for an answer online on your own first. The reason for this is that learning to google `R` and `git` errors _efficiently_ is an essential skill for anyone who codes, and you should try to learn it as early as possible.\n\n### Classes\n\nIf you have a question during the class, don't hesitate to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\n\n\n### Office hours\n\nIf for whatever reason you'd rather come and talk in person rather than post on the GitHub discussions, you can do this during the office hours. Considering the deadline for homework in on Monday, I will make sure to keep the slot on Friday, 14:00-16:00, for the office hours. This is, however, not the only time I am available. You can always just [pick from the time slots that work for me](https://calendly.com/vktrsmnv/r4da) on that particular week and come at a different day/time. You can come in groups if you want. Just note that you'll need to let me know you're coming at least 6 hours in advance. \n\n### GitHub discussions\n\nHave a question that can't wait for office hours? Prefer to write out your question in detail rather than asking in person? Our Discussions forum on GitHub is the best venue for these. Once you join the GitHub organization for this course, you will have access to the discussion tool. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts in the channel before adding a new one. If you know the answer to a question that is posted, I encourage you to respond and if someone's response was helpful, you can mark it as an answer! \n\n### Email\n\nPlease refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go to Discussions), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g., illness, accommodations, etc.). For such matters, you may email me at [semenova@uni-mannheim.de](mailto:semenova@uni-mannheim.de?subject=r4da // Your subject).  Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to emails within 24 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.\n\n\n### Online Resources \n\nComputer programming can be frustrating because computers are stupid, and error messages are not always helpful. Fortunately, help is out there.  [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a Q&A site dedicated to helping people with their programming problems. [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is a similar concept, but tailored for people using RStudio (which applies to us). If you see these websites when you are googling your errors, these would quite likely contain some helpful info.  \n\nSearching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is basically a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for \"r scatterplot\", but if it does struggle, try searching for \"rstats\" instead (e.g. \"rstats scatterplot\").\n\n![](https://mermaid.ink/img/pako:eNpVUl1r20AQ_CtbGUoCNnVpH4IKDUkUmoS2YNqnynnY6FbWkdOteh9xRZT_3j1ZNrb0cuzsziyz85pVrCjLs43DroHfxdqCfFdnZYMvBAh_I_mg2V4-nsNi8RWuzzpyni0a0N5HOp8GRvDmrOLoPEGLgZxGM6HXI1qU1KKWOeuDi1Vg97iDbxI8sNvgAHel9qCDNEFoCHxvDD5Ffzm13o2tPfkB7ktHns0LqXdwgloe4KFE4whVD2xBdoJvOjTxaU_zcERzXEmj30sf0AWwtIXV-ytZIxGlhQrtq-i9uOFPNpdF2fUielxMvu4sGuB252bPEYLTpGDDvDG03-Z2tGeItiHT1dEcmCbgUL4_Fkg2oriTrvOhQae26A6KP8uKW4LAwHWtK4ImHWbSK0baVblFMfrzxQm22kmi9VtypA6aU90yiOudOCAiEpa1rQx6X1ANimqMJkDFhl0-u1gulx-X81obk8_qup7L0fmZ8pnUp_diq1Vo8k_dvy9JJLGlP5tnLTmJipJcvo5IJha3tM5yeSp0z-tsbd-kD2PgX72tslwSRfMsdkqSV2iUOLf7IiktWfuxy_kY93nWof3DLC01Gk9v_wG-zvsd?type=png)\n\n## Course structure\n\n### In-person classes\n\nWe meet weekly from 12:00–13:30 on Tuesdays in C217 in A5, 6. There are *no PCs* in the room so if you want to follow along during the labs (which I encourage you to do), you will need to bring a laptop. Alternatively, you could work from a tablet with a [cloud version of Rstudio](/resource/install.html#cloud-version-of-rstudio), but this would be less convenient. \n\nI expect you to come to the sessions prepared, which means having completed everything that is listed for the respective week in [Prepare](/prepare/) section of the website. We will have a short lecture-part and then we will move to code-along part and other activities. \n\n### Homework Assignments\n\nThe only way to learn programming is through practice, which means you will have coding homework assignments. These problem sets will not be long but will be frequent, so you will need to submit them *weekly.* While your first few assignments will be individual because I want to ensure that everyone gets comfortable with the workflow, as we progress during the semester, we will switch to group assignments. You will need to work in groups of 2-3 students, as this way you will learn more about the collaborative part of working with `git`. I will let you know more about this as the semester goes. \n\nI will distribute homework assignments via GitHub after our sessions on Tuesday. You will have until next Monday, 12:00 (noon) to complete the problem set. You will need to upload your solutions to GitHub by the deadline (this will be known as to `push`), and I will evaluate the latest version that is available on GitHub on Mondays 12:00. I will try to grade problem sets the same day and provide you with feedback by our session on Tuesday (but let's see how this goes). \n\nContent-wise, the problem sets will be primarily coding tasks, but they will also include theoretical questions related to readings and \"lectures\" once in a while. In order to pass the assignment, I need to see that you have tried to solve every task, and most of the tasks should be completed correctly. \n\nYou can find descriptions for all the assignments on the [assignments page](/assignment/).\n\n### Attendance and participation\n\nAttendance and participation are important to your success in this course. You're expected to come to class each Tuesday prepared—having read the material and watched the videos—and ready to discuss the content and work with R. \n\nHowever, if you are sick, please just let me know you're not coming if you can (so I can adjust the activities in class if needed) and stay home. \n\nSince active participation is listed as a coursework requirement, I will take attendance at some point during the session.  \n\n## Evaluation and Grading policy\n\n\n### Final Paper \nGrades for this class are intended to assess your learning about (1) data and code, (2) scientific and critical reasoning, and (3) statistical reasoning. Following university regulations, **100% of your grade will be determined by a final paper**. Make sure to sign up for the examination via Portal2 in addition to registering for the class during the semester (otherwise, I cannot submit your grade).\n\nYour final project will be a data essay: you will get a dataset, a research question, and one or two hypotheses based on a short theoretical story in our final session. You will need to select a research design to test the hypotheses and thus answer the research question. The project must be completed individually, without any cooperation. You will have until June 13, 2023 to complete the data essay[^deadline]. \n\n[^deadline]: Once we have the exam schedule for the lectures, we can revisit the deadline issue. Either way, you will have 14 days to complete the assignment. \n\nData essay is designed to primarily evaluate the skills gained in this class, hence the focus on data analysis and presentation. If you are in your final semesters and feel like you would benefit more from working on a paper of your own, you are welcome to discuss this option with me **before May 15, 2023**, so we can agree on the option that would be a relevant evaluation for this class but also helpful for _you_.  \n\nI can only evaluate the final papers if you pass all the course requirements during the lecture period. This means two things:\n\n\n### Active Participation \n\nShould you miss more than two classes, it is your responsibility to reach out to me timely so we can agree on the way to compensate for the the missing session.  \n\n### Homework assignments\n\nYou need to pass all of the homework assignments.\nPlease note that handing in the assignment is **necessary but not sufficient** for passing. Should the homework be below the standard of passing, I will ask you to resubmit that assignment but no more than twice during the semester[^failing]. I will use a point scale for evaluation and you will need to have more than half of the total points for that homework to pass.\nFor group assignments, each student is expected to make contributions (aka *commits*) to the homework repository, but all team members who contributed to the repository receive the same point score. \n *As an extra incentive, the student(s) who will have the highest score for the problem sets at the end of the course will get a final grade improvement of 0.3 points.*  There are no adverse effects for others, so you can still get a 1.0 for the class without the bonus. \nSee [Late work and extensions](/syllabus.html#late-work-and-extensions) for more info.\n\n[^failing]: Since some students like to use this option to get extra time to submit the assignments, for the sake of equanimity and your learning progress I want to discourage this behavior.\n\n### (Optional) Presentation\n\nYou could prepare an 8-10-minute presentation or a blog post for this website about a topic related to data visualization, data wrangling, or something else related to the course content. By doing this, you will see how easy it is to make slides right inside R (which is very useful when you need to present your analysis) and also get more practice collaborating using GitHub. \n\nYou can do this task alone or in pairs, and completing it would improve your final grade by 0.3 point (no adverse effects otherwise, you can still pass the coursework requirements and/or get a 1.0 for the class without doing this assignment). You can find more information about the task [here](assignment/presentation.html). Talk to me if you are interested.\n\n\n\n\n## Course policies\n\n**Be nice. Be honest. Don't cheat.**\n\n### Late work and extensions\n\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure that I can provide feedback within a timely manner. This means that for homework assignments, your GitHub repositories will be closed to contributions at the deadline, which means you cannot edit them any longer and submit files. \n\nOnce during the semester you may get an unexplained extension and submit the assignment late (but no later than 6 days after the deadline). If there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a homework assignment by the stated due date, please [email](mailto:semenova@uni-mannheim.de?subject=r4da // late submission) me _before the deadline_. In your email, you only need to request the waiver, you do not need to provide explanation.\n\nFor the final project, as a rule no late work will be accepted. \n\n<!-- ### Regrade requests  -->\n\n<!-- Regrade requests must be made within one week of when the assignment is returned, and must be submitted via [email](mailto:semenova@uni-mannheim.de?subject=r4da // regrade request). Note that during the regrade process your score could go up or go down or not change. -->\n\n\n### Collaboration \n\nCollaboration and consultation with your classmates will help you learn. I encourage good-natured collaboration on assignments, but you must turn in your own work (or the work of your group). For individual assignments, you are welcome to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself. Plagiarism is easy to spot—I know because I have spotted it in the past—and will not be tolerated. Assignment sheets may contain additional guidance on acceptable forms of collaboration, and I am more than happy to answer your questions on acceptable forms of collaboration.\n\n\n### Sharing and reusing code\n\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\n### Syllabus Change\n\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the semester. Deviations may become necessary as the semester progresses. Except for changes that substantially affect the implementation of the evaluation (grading) statement, this syllabus and our schedule is a guide for the course and is subject to change with advance notice. \n\n### Recording course content\n\nI kindly ask you to refrain from recording (including audio) during our class. For one reason, your fellow classmates may speak up but not consent to being recorded and doing so violates their privacy. If you feel that you need to record the *lecture* part of the sessions, using audio or video devices, you must get permission from me ahead of time and these recordings should be used for personal study only, no for distribution. \n\n### Computer emergencies\n\nI am not sympathetic about computer emergencies. In general, you should learn to keep your work so that it shouldn't matter if your computer explodes. If it does explode, you will lose only the work after your last sync. You can then restart your work on a public computer, like the one at the uni. For this course in particular, because I expect you to use a cloud service GitHub in your workflow and the availability of Posit.cloud (a cloud version of the software we will be using), a broken computer will not be a valid reason to ask for an extension. \n\n### Accessibility and accommodations\n\nIt is my goal that this class is an accessible and welcoming experience for all students, including those with disabilities that may impact learning in this class. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options. After registration, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion. Please consult the [University website](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/academics/advice-and-services/advice-for-students-with-disabilities-or-chronic-illnesses/) for more information on the topic. \n\n<!-- ### Pronouns -->\n<!-- Pronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive. Please update your gender pronouns in Slack.  -->\n\n\n### Foods and drinks in class\n\nI am totally fine with you bringing drinks, especially caffeine-containing, to the class. However, please do not use the class time to have snacks or lunch. \n\n## Student feedback\n\nOnce we are halfway through the class, I will ask you for some feedback regarding the class. We will discuss your responses and I will try to incorporate this feedback for the second part of the class. At the end of the course, you will receive the official evaluations administered by the University, and I would appreciate you filling those in. \nApart from these opportunities, you are always welcome to share your concerns or feedback any time during the course, in person during office hours or anonymously via the [pop-up form on the course website](https://viktoriiasemenova.typeform.com/to/A8mIv5vG). \n\n## Acknoweldgements\n\nThis course benefited greatly from other publicly available course resources, in particular [Gov50 by Matt Blackwell](https://gov50.mattblackwell.org/) (Harvard University), [Advanced Data Visualisation by Mine Cetinskaya-Rundlett](https://vizdata.org/) (Duke University), [Data Visualization by Andrew Heiss](https://datavizs22.classes.andrewheiss.com/) (Georgia State University), and [Quantitative Methods in Political Science by Thomas Gschwend](https://qm2021.netlify.app/) (University of Mannheim).   \n\n\n\n<!-- You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the [assignments page](/assignment/). -->\n\n\n\n<!-- ```{r assignments-grades, include=FALSE} -->\n<!-- assignments <- tribble( -->\n<!--   ~Points,   ~Assignment, -->\n<!--   14 * 10,   \"Weekly check-ins (14 × 10)\", -->\n<!--   9 * 30,    \"Problem sets (9 × 30)\", -->\n<!--   4 * 30,    \"Evaluation assignments (4 × 30)\", -->\n<!--   100,       \"Exam 1\", -->\n<!--   100,       \"Exam 2\", -->\n<!--   200,       \"Final project\" -->\n<!-- ) %>% -->\n<!--   mutate(Percent = Points / sum(Points), -->\n<!--          Percent = scales::percent(Percent)) -->\n\n<!-- grading <- tribble( -->\n<!--   ~Grade, ~Range, ~Grade1, ~Range1, -->\n<!--   \"1.0\",  \"95–100%\", \"3.0\",  \"73–76%\", -->\n<!--   \"1.3\", \"90–94%\", \"3.3\", \"70–72%\", -->\n<!--   \"1.7\", \"85–89%\", \"3.7\", \"67–69%\", -->\n<!--   \"2.0\",  \"80–84%\", \"4.0\",  \"63–66%\", -->\n<!--   \"2.3\", \"75–79%\", \"5.0\", \"< 50%\", -->\n<!--   \"2.7\", \"70–74%\",  -->\n<!-- ) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- <div class=\"centered-table\"> -->\n\n<!-- ```{r show-assignments-table, echo=FALSE, results=\"asis\"} -->\n<!-- assignments_total <- tibble(Assignment = \"Total\", -->\n<!--                             Points = sum(assignments$Points), -->\n<!--                             Percent = NA) -->\n\n<!-- bind_rows(assignments, assignments_total) %>% -->\n<!--   select(Assignment, Points, Percent) %>% -->\n<!--   pandoc.table(justify = \"lcc\", missing = \"—\") -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n<!-- </div> -->\n\n<!-- <div class=\"centered-table\"> -->\n\n<!-- ```{r show-grades-table, echo=FALSE, results=\"asis\"} -->\n<!-- grading %>% -->\n<!--   pandoc.table(justify = \"lclc\", -->\n<!--                col.names = c(\"Grade\", \"Range\", \"Grade\", \"Range\")) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- <div> -->\n\n\n<!-- ## Friends -->\n\n<!-- Once you have read this entire syllabus and [the assignments page](/assignment/), please DM me on Slack a picture of a Friends TV show character.[^friends] Brownie points if it's animated. -->\n\n<!-- [^friends]: Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, Joe...  -->\n\n<!-- <figure> -->\n<!-- <img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/j4q4h9uWKWwnYT1k3Z/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Baby Yoda with IG-11\"> -->\n<!-- </figure> -->\n",
