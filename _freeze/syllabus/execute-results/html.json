Later in the semester we'll turn to the powerful toolbox of causal inference approaches, but continue to keep the focus on data as we do so. -->\n\n\nThis class will expose you to [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)—one of the most popular, sought-after, and in-demand statistical programming languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you'll learn in this class, you'll know enough to be able to find how to analyze any sort of data-based question in the future.\n\n## Important pep talk!\n\nI *promise* you can succeed in this class.\n\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it's like learning a new language, just like French or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you'll be using like `ggplot2`—[made this wise observation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/):\n\n> It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you're finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../../../../../files/img/syllabus/hosrt_error_tweet.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[![Alison Horst: Gator error](/files/img/syllabus/gator_error.jpg)](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1213275783675822080)\n\n\n## Course materials\n\nAll of the material used in this class is available for free. \n\n### Books & Videos\n\nThere are multiple good books published recently on the topic of causal inference. For this class, we will be using the one written by an economist Nick Huntington-Klein:\n\n- Nick Huntington-Klein, *The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality* (CRC Press, 2021), <https://theeffectbook.net/>. ([**Free as a HTML version!**](https://theeffectbook.net/) The print version is available at the library.)\n\nThe book is quite lengthy but worry not, it is written at a more general, easy-to-understand level with relatively minimal math. *You do not need to understand all the equations and notation.* Another bonus with this book is the YouTube videos available for each chapter. They are no substitutes of the book but will be a great place to start to make the reading much easier. \n\n\nOn the topic of causal inference, there are three more books I would recommend if you'd prefer a different take for some reason. \n\n- Ethan Bueno de Mesquita and Anthony Fowler, *Thinking Clearly with Data: A Guide to Quantitative Reasoning and Analysis* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2021). \n- Scott Cunningham, *Causal Inference: The Mixtape* (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2021), <https://mixtape.scunning.com/>. [**Also free(!)**](https://mixtape.scunning.com/). \n- Joshua D. Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke, *Mastering ’Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2015). \n\n*Thinking Clearly with Data* is an introductory book for quantitative methods, with an emphasis on reserach design and causal inference tools. We will read excerpts from it during the course. \n*The Mixtape* is a more detailed and mathier approach to these causal inference methods, while *'Metrics Matter* is a fairly canonical (and accessible!) book in the world of econometrics. \n\nFor the topic of data visualization, we will rely on various sources:\n\n- Kieran Healy. *Data Visualization: A practical introduction* http://socviz.co/\n\n- \n\n\nAll assigned chapters and links to the resources you will need to prapare for our weekly sessions will be included on the reading page for that week.\n\n### R, RStudio, git, and GitHub\n\nWe will learn data analysis by *doing* data analysis. We will use the open-source (and free!) statistical programming language called [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/). `R` is very popular in data science and statistics, it makes beautiful graphics, and it is great fun. You will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\n\nTo make our workflow with R more efficient, we will also be using version control tool called `git` and its online hosting Github. In a nutshell, think of this as a collaborative tool like Google Docs, but for code and on steroids. We will use Github to distribute material for our sessions, hand out and collect homework assignments, and provide you with feedback on your homework, too. I have taught introductory stats classes with and without `git`, and speaking from the experience, I promise, using this tool _will_ make your life easier.\n\nYou can [find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and git here.](/resource/install/)\n\n## Getting Help\n\nComputer programming can be frustrating because computers are stupid, and error messages are not always helpful. Fortunately, help is out there. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a Q&A site dedicated to helping people with their programming problems. [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is a similar concept, but tailored for people using RStudio (which applies to us). If you see these websites when you are googlng your errors, these would quite likely contain soem helpful info.  \n\nSearching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is basically a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for \"r scatterplot\", but if it does struggle, try searching for \"rstats\" instead (e.g. \"rstats scatterplot\").\n\nAdditionally, we have a class workspace at [Slack](https://data-s23.slack.com) where anyone signed up can ask questions and anyone can answer. **I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly.** You'll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you'll likely be able to answer other peoples' questions, too. Help each other out! \n\n\n## Course structure\n\n### Weekly Sessions\n\nWe meet weekly from 12:00–13:30 on Tuesdays in C217 in A5, 6. \n\nI expect you to come to the sessions prepared, so will have a short lecture-part and then we will move along to activities, such as R labs. \n\n### Weekly Homework Assignments\n\nThe only way to earn programming is through practice, which means you will have homework assignments. These assignments will not be long but will be frequent, i.e. you will do them weekly. While your first few assignments will be individual because I want to ensure that everyone gets comfortable with the workflow, further during the semester you will also have group assignments. I will let you know more about this as the semester goes. \n\nI will distribute homework assignments via Github after our sessions on Tuesday. You will have until next Monday, 12:00 (noon) to complete them. I will try to grade them the same day and provide you with feedback by our session on Tuesday (but let's see how this goes). \n\n### Office Hours\n\nIf for whatever reason you'd rather come and talk in person rather than post on Slack, you can do this during the office hours. Considering the deadline for homework in on Monday, I will make sure to keep the slot on Friday, 15:00-16:00, for the office hours. This is, however, not the only time I am available. You can always just [pick from the time slots that work for me](https://calendly.com/vktrsmnv/data-s23) on that particular week and come at a different day/time. You can come in groups if you want. Just note that you'll need to let me know you're coming at least 6 hours in advance. \n\n\n## Attendance and participation\n\nYou're expected to come to class each Tuesday prepared—having read the material and watched the videos—and ready to discuss the content and work with R. \n\nAttendance and participation are important to your success in this course. However, if you are sick, please just let me know you're not coming if you can (so I can adjust the activities in class if needed) and stay home.\n\nOfficially, one of your coursework requirements is active participation. \n\n\n\n## Course policies\n\n**Be nice. Be honest. Don't cheat.**\n\n\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the semester. Deviations may become necessary as the semester progresses.\n\n\n### Late work\n\nYou will lose 1 point per day for each day a problem set is late. This is designed to not be a huge penalty (3 days late = 27/30 points on a problem set that gets a ✓), but instead is a commitment device to help you stay on schedule.\n\n### Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS)\n\nLife at GSU can be complicated and challenging (especially during a pandemic!). You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. [Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS)](https://education.gsu.edu/cps/) provides free, *confidential* support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The CPS office is staffed by professional psychologists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact CPS for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n\n### Basic needs security\n\n\n\n### Academic honesty\n\nViolation of [GSU's Policy on Academic Honesty](https://deanofstudents.gsu.edu/faculty-staff-resources/academic-honesty/) will result in an F in the course and possible disciplinary action.[^cheat] All violations will be formally reported to the Dean of Students.\n\n[^cheat]: So seriously, just don't cheat or plagiarize!\n\n### Special needs\n\nStudents who wish to request accommodation for a disability may do so by registering with the [Office of Disability Services](https://disability.gsu.edu/). Students may only be accommodated upon issuance by the Office of Disability Services of a signed [Accommodation Plan](https://disability.gsu.edu/services/how-to-register/) and are responsible for providing a copy of that plan to instructors of all classes in which accommodations are sought.\n\nStudents with special needs should then make an appointment with me during the first week of class to discuss any accommodations that need to be made.\n\n\n## Grading policy\n\nGrades for this class are intended to assess your learning about (1) data and code, (2) scientific and critical reasoning, and (3) statistical reasoning. Following university regulations, **100% of your grade will be determined by a final paper**. Make sure to sign up for the examination via Portal2 in addition to registering for the class during the semester (otherwise, I cannot submit your grade).\n\nI will only evaluate the final papers if you pass all the course requirements during the lecture period. This means two things.\n\n\n#### Active Participation \n\nShould you miss more than two classes, it is your responsibility to reach out to me in advance so we can agree on the way to compensate for the the missing session. You might ask you to do a short presentation in class or prepare a short text on a relevant topic for the class website. \n\n#### Homework assignments\n\nYou need to pass all of the homework assignments.\nPlease note that handing in the assignment is **necessary but not sufficient** for passing. Should the homework be below the standard of passing, I will ask you to resubmit that assignment but no more than twice during the semester[^failing]. \nFor group assignments, I measure each student's contribution with commits they made to the homework repository. \n\n\n\n\n[^failing]: I noticed some students like to use this option to get extra time to submit the assignments and for the sake of equanimity, I want to discourage this behavior.\n\n\n<!-- You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the [assignments page](/assignment/). -->\n\n\n\n<!-- ```{r assignments-grades, include=FALSE} -->\n<!-- assignments <- tribble( -->\n<!--   ~Points,   ~Assignment, -->\n<!--   14 * 10,   \"Weekly check-ins (14 × 10)\", -->\n<!--   9 * 30,    \"Problem sets (9 × 30)\", -->\n<!--   4 * 30,    \"Evaluation assignments (4 × 30)\", -->\n<!--   100,       \"Exam 1\", -->\n<!--   100,       \"Exam 2\", -->\n<!--   200,       \"Final project\" -->\n<!-- ) %>% -->\n<!--   mutate(Percent = Points / sum(Points), -->\n<!--          Percent = scales::percent(Percent)) -->\n\n<!-- grading <- tribble( -->\n<!--   ~Grade, ~Range, ~Grade1, ~Range1, -->\n<!--   \"1.0\",  \"95–100%\", \"3.0\",  \"73–76%\", -->\n<!--   \"1.3\", \"90–94%\", \"3.3\", \"70–72%\", -->\n<!--   \"1.7\", \"85–89%\", \"3.7\", \"67–69%\", -->\n<!--   \"2.0\",  \"80–84%\", \"4.0\",  \"63–66%\", -->\n<!--   \"2.3\", \"75–79%\", \"5.0\", \"< 50%\", -->\n<!--   \"2.7\", \"70–74%\",  -->\n<!-- ) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- <div class=\"centered-table\"> -->\n\n<!-- ```{r show-assignments-table, echo=FALSE, results=\"asis\"} -->\n<!-- assignments_total <- tibble(Assignment = \"Total\", -->\n<!--                             Points = sum(assignments$Points), -->\n<!--                             Percent = NA) -->\n\n<!-- bind_rows(assignments, assignments_total) %>% -->\n<!--   select(Assignment, Points, Percent) %>% -->\n<!--   pandoc.table(justify = \"lcc\", missing = \"—\") -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n<!-- </div> -->\n\n<!-- <div class=\"centered-table\"> -->\n\n<!-- ```{r show-grades-table, echo=FALSE, results=\"asis\"} -->\n<!-- grading %>% -->\n<!--   pandoc.table(justify = \"lclc\", -->\n<!--                col.names = c(\"Grade\", \"Range\", \"Grade\", \"Range\")) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- <div> -->\n\n\n## Friends\n\nOnce you have read this entire syllabus and [the assignments page](/assignment/), please DM me on Slack a picture of a Friends TV show character.[^friends] Brownie points if it's animated.\n\n[^friends]: Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, Joe... \n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/j4q4h9uWKWwnYT1k3Z/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Baby Yoda with IG-11\">\n</figure>\n",
