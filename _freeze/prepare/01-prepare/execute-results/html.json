It would be best if you try installing all the necessary software *before* our class on Tuesday. First, I would like you to install both `R` and RStudio on your computer. Then, move to `git` and GitHub.\n\n### What is `R`?\n\n`R` is a free and open-source programming language designed to help you perform data-related tasks, such as wrangling, statistical analysis, visualization, and many more things (this website and pretty much all of the material for this class was created wit R). `R` is getting more popular and knowledge of `R` will help you in the job market. Think of it as a very powerful engine in a car.\n\n### What is RStudio?\n\nWe will communicate with R via RStudio, a so-called integrated development environment. This means, we will never be opening `R` directly, but rather only work in this program. RStudio is a very well-maintained commercial product, but the free version that we will be using, Rstudio Desktop, has more than enough features to make working with `R` more user-friendly. Think of it as a dashboard, which we will be using to communicate with the engine, `R`. Note that RStudio is not a requirement for programming with R, although it's very commonly used.\n\n![](/files/img/prepare/r_vs_rstudio_1.png)\n\n### How to Install R\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### <i class=\"fab fa-windows\"></i> Windows users\n\n1.  Open your browser and go to <https://cran.rstudio.com>.\n\n2.  Click on *Download R for Windows* and select *base*. This is the version you want when you are installing `R` for the first time,\n\n3.  Click on *Download R-4.2.2 for Windows*.\n\n4.  Run the installation from the `.exe` file you just downloaded.\n\n5.  Now that `R` is installed, proceed to installing RStudio.\n\n#### <i class=\"fab fa-apple\"></i> macOS users\n\n1.  Open your browser and go to <https://cran.rstudio.com>.\n\n2.  Check whether your Mac has an Intel-based processor or an M1 (or higher). You can find this info under <i class=\"fab fa-apple\"></i> \\> About This Mac \\> Overview \\> Processor.\n\n![](https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3594298/mac_model_serial_apple_logo.jpg)\n\n3.  Click on *Download R for macOS* and scroll down to the respective `.pkg` file in the list of files and download it.\n\n4.  Run the installation from the `.pkg` file you just downloaded.\n\n5.  Download and install XQuartz: https://www.xquartz.org/.\n\n6.  Now that `R` is installed, proceed to installing RStudio.\n:::\n\n### How to Install RStudio\n\n1.  Go to <https://posit.co/> and click on the *Download RStudio* button on the top bar.\n2.  Scroll down and click on the *Download* button for the free RStudio Desktop version.\n3.  Since we've already completed Step 1: Install R, move to Step 2 and download the latest version of Rstudio Desktop for your operating system.\n4.  Run the installer. Click *yes* through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\n### What are git and GitHub?\n\nGit is a version control system that makes it easy to track changes and work on code collaboratively. `git` is a software you run locally on your computer. Version control allows you to store versions of your project as you progress, so you can come back to any version of the project, and accompany everything with human readable messages.\n\nWith git, writing code for a project will look somewhat like this:\n\n![](/files/img/prepare/lego-steps-commit-messages.png)\n\nGitHub is a hosting service for `git`. You can think of it as a Dropbox for code (but much better). It contains projects, which we call *repositories* or *repos*, and these repos can be public or private. This is a tool I will use to distribute code and homework assignments to you and collect them. And you will use it to keep track of your code and collaborate in teams. Github has a nice integration with Rstudio, so using this tool will minimize the amount of work you will need to do.\n\nWe will have a course organization on Github (like a course page on ILIAS), so your workflow will look something like this. We will go over it in class.\n\n![](/files/img/prepare/github-workflow-04.png)\n\n### How to Get a GitHub account\n\n1.  Go to <https://github.com/> and create an account.\n2.  Use your `ILIAS-login` as a username.\n\n### How to Install `git` on Your Computer\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### <i class=\"fab fa-windows\"></i> Windows users\n\n1.  Go to <https://git-scm.com/downloads> and click on your operating system.\n2.  Download the latest release (at the time of writing, it is 2.39.0). Follow the instructions and install git.\n    -   When asked about \"Adjusting your PATH environment\", make sure to select *\"Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software\"*.\n\n#### <i class=\"fab fa-apple\"></i> macOS users\n\n**Recommended option**: *Install the Xcode command line tools (not all of Xcode), which includes Git*. This requires you opening Terminal on your Mac, i.e. we will install stuff by typing what to do rather than clicking on the buttons in programs. Don't get intimidated, it's easier than you think. \n\n1. Go to the Terminal and type these commands to elicit an offer to install developer command line tools:\n\n```\ngit --version\ngit config\n```\n\n2. Accept the offer.  Click on \"Install\".\n\n**Alternative approach** (no command line required).\n\n1.  Go to <https://git-scm.com/downloads> and click on your operating system.\n2.  Download the latest release (at the time of writing, it is 2.39.0). Follow the instructions and install git.\n    -   When asked about \"Adjusting your PATH environment\", make sure to select *\"Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software\"*.\n    \n:::\n\n### How to check that `git` was installed properly? \n\nTo make sure that you did everything right and you're all set, do this:\n\n1. Open RStudio. The icons look similar, you need the right one: ![](/files/img/prepare/r_vs_rstudio_2.png){width=2in}\n\n2. Go to lower left part of the window and click on *Terminal*. \n![](/files/img/prepare/Rstudio_overview.png){width=100% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n3. Type `git` in the Terminal. You should see something like this:\n![](/files/img/prepare/git-in-terminal.gif){width=100% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\nIf you are typing in the *Console* pane instead of *Terminal*, you will see this error. Make sure to switch to *Terminal*.  \n![](/files/img/prepare/git-in-console.svg){width=60% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n",
