D. 2014. [\"Causal Effect of Intergroup Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes.\"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1317670111) *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* 111(10): 3699--3704.\n\nSubjects in the experiment were individuals riding on the commuter rail line and overwhelmingly white. Every morning, multiple trains pass through various stations in suburban communities that were used for this study. For pairs of trains leaving the same station at roughly the same time, one was randomly assigned to receive the treatment and one was designated as a control. By doing so all the benefits of randomization apply for this dataset.\n\nThe treatment in this experiment was the presence of two native Spanish-speaking 'confederates' (a term used in experiments to indicate that these individuals worked for the researcher, unbeknownst to the subjects) on the platform each morning prior to the train's arrival. The presence of these confederates, who would appear as Hispanic foreigners to the subjects, was intended to simulate the kind of demographic change anticipated for the United States in coming years. For those individuals in the control group, no such confederates were present on the platform. The treatment was administered for 10 days. Participants were asked questions related to immigration policy both before the experiment started and after the experiment had ended. You will be working withe the dataset with these variables (names may differ slightly):\n\n| Variable         | Description                                                                                                            |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| `treatment`      | variable with two levels: \"Treated\" and \"Control\"                                                                      |\n| `att_start`      | starting attitude toward immigration issues.

Please answer the following questions in text and with the code where it is needed. I provide you with some template code that can help in answering one of the questions in the chunk below.\n\n-   How many variables are there?\n\n> There are 14 variables in the dataset.\n\n-   How many observations exist?\n\n> There are 115 observations. \n\n-   How many of the observations belong to *Treatment* and how many to *Control* condition?\n\n> 64 observations belong to the  *Control* condition, the rest of them, 51 cases,  belong to *Treatment* group. \n\n-   What are the types of variables (conceptually, not inside `R`)? Recall the plot from the slides.\n\n> `att_start`, `att_end`, `ideology_start`, `ideology_end` are, based on the description of them, ordinal, yet due to a large number of categories `att_start`, `att_end`, can be treated as discrete numeric ones in practice. `gender`, `race`, `liberal`, `party`, `line`, and `station` are all nominal, and `hisp_perc` and `income` are continuous numeric variables. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(trains)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 115  14\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# number of values per group\ntrains %>%\n  pull(treatment) %>%\n  table()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n.\nControl Treated \n     64      51 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# share of values per group\ntrains %>%\n  pull(treatment) %>%\n  table() %>%\n  prop.table()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n.\n  Control   Treated \n0.5565217 0.4434783 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Task 3: Plots for Continuous Discrete Variables\n\n### 3.1: Make the plots\n\nCreate two plots for the distribution of immigration attitudes *before* the experiment. For the first plot, use `geom_histogram()`. For the second plot, use `geom_bar` or make a lollipop plot (see the lab for the code example).\n\nPut the code for the plots into the chunks with respective labels. Don't forget to make the plots reader-friendly!\n\n> Hint: you are welcome to play around with themes argument.

Why do you think so?\n\n> Barplot is a better choice given that this variable has discrete values, as it communicates the nature of the variable clearer. The gaps between the bars signal that there are no values in-between. \n\n## Task 4: Recreating a Plot with Layered `geom`s\n\nWhen looking at the data from the experiments, we often want to compare the characteristics of the respondents across groups. We should have have very similar groups, on average, to ba able to make valid inferences from the experiment. In this case, we would like to know if prior attitudes to immigration differ between (1) those who got assigned to the treatment condition and (2) those who were assigned to the control condition. Below you see a plot that could allow for such a comparison.\n\n![](images/prior_attitudes_balance.png)\n\n### 4.1: Recreate this plot\n\n> Hint: order of layers makes a difference: layers may override the preceeding ones. \n> Hint: you can use `geom_jitter` for the points. \n> Hint: you may not get the points at *exactly* the same places, and that's okay.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(\n  data = trains,\n  mapping = aes(\n    x = att_start,\n    y = treatment\n  )\n) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Immigration Attitudes among Boston Commuters\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Enos (2014)\",\n    x = \"Attitudes before Experiment\",\n    y = \"\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](problem_set_solutions_files/figure-pdf/prior-attitudes-balance-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### 4.2: Discuss the plot\n\nWhat is your conclusion regarding the \"balance\" of the groups: do we seem to have, on average, similar prior immigration attitudes across groups?\n\n> There do not seem to be large differences between the distributions in *Treatment* and *Control* groups. The boxplot indicates that the medians are close to one another in values, and with the IQRs of both distributions overlapping strongly. We can also observe, not very clearly though, that there are more observations in the contol group. However, given that we have not conducted any proper statistical tests, it is hard to answer this question based on the lot alone. \n\n### 4.3: Discuss the design of the plot\n\nDiscuss design choices behind the plot:\n\n-   What do you think is the purpose of adding each `geom` layer?\n\n> The boxplot presents the summary statistics, namely the median and the IQR, in a concise way, which simplifies the comparison of the distributions between treatment groups. The points here convey the infomation about the number of observations in each group. \n\n-   Can either of them be omitted without loosing information?\n\n> Both communicate different kinds of information, so we cannot drop either of them without losing information. \n\n-   Is there any more information about the distributions of prior immigration attitudes conditional on the treatment status you would like to have?\n\n> It would be helpful to also see the mean value and the density of the distribution. \n\n-   Is it helpful in this case to remove the values on the horizontal axis? Why (not)?\n\n> By default, some of the values get omitted, i.e. we do not have each value of the variable possible (from 3 to 15). With such a small number of values, we can include them all to reduce the cognitive load for the reader. What would also be helpful is including the information about the scale of the index, i.e. whoch values depict more conservative attitudes. \n\n### 4.4: Make an alternative (optional)\n\nCan you think of an alternative way to convey the same information graphically (e.g., using different `geom`s)? Or any adjustments to the current version of the plot? Make that plot!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(\n  data = trains,\n  mapping = aes(\n    x = att_start,\n    y = treatment\n  )\n) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.3) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.1, width = 0.3, color = \"#800010\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Immigration Attitudes among Boston Commuters\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Enos (2014)\",\n    x = \"Attitudes before Experiment\",\n    y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(3, 15, by = 1)) +\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"text\", x = c(3.5, 14.5), y = 0.25,\n    label = c(\"Least Conservative\", \"Most Conservative\"), \n    size = 3, fontface = 3\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\", # moves the title to the left \n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"), # bold font for plot title\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), # removes ticks on y-axis (aesthetic choice)\n    panel.grid.major.y =  element_blank(), # removes grid lines between integers\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank() # removes grid lines between integers\n  ) +\n  coord_cartesian(\n    ylim = c(1, 2), #  restricts the y-axis to the range of interest \n    clip = 'off' # allows for annotations outside of the plot space \n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](problem_set_solutions_files/figure-pdf/alternative-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> Note that this solution includes the layers we have not yet discussed, but I provide it in case you want to see some examples. These are the changes made to the original plot: (1) clearer x-axis labels for only the reasonable values; (2) infomration about the scale; (3) smaller jittering of the points to still preserve their positions on the x-axis visually; (4) density added to show the shape of the distribution. \n\n\n### 4.5: Make a plot for another variable\n\nNow compare the immigration attitudes *after* the experiment across treatment and control groups with the same plot. Based on this plot alone, what can you conclude about the effect of the treatment?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(\n  data = trains,\n  mapping = aes(\n    x = att_end,\n    y = treatment\n  )\n) +\n  geom_boxplot(color = \"#800010\") +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.3, alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Immigration Attitudes among Boston Commuters\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Enos (2014)\",\n    x = \"Attitudes after Experiment\",\n    y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(3, 15, by = 1)) +\n  theme(    panel.grid.minor = element_blank() # removes grid lines between integers\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](problem_set_solutions_files/figure-pdf/post-attitudes-balance-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n> Unlike before, there seem to be an outlier in the distribution in the control group, so in order to emphasize it, I adjust the color of the boxplot to be different from that of the rest of the points. In comparison to the previous plots, we can observe a stronger disparity between the *Treated* and *Control* groups: the difference between the medians is now 2 points. Yet as above, it is hard to make conclusions regarding the effect of the treatment solely based on the plots. Moreover, if we are interested in the effect of the treatment, it might have been useful to also incorporate the information about the prior attitudes (yet not necessary), which we do not do with such a visualization. \n\n\n## Task 5: Visualize Categorical Variables\n\nBelow you can find the code to create (very basic) barplots for the *race* variable. As with immigration attitudes, we want to know if we had similar distributions for races across treatment conditions.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"3\" layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](problem_set_solutions_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf)\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](problem_set_solutions_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-8-2.pdf)\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](problem_set_solutions_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-8-3.pdf)\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](problem_set_solutions_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-8-4.pdf)\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](problem_set_solutions_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-8-5.pdf)\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](problem_set_solutions_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-8-6.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### 5.1: Discuss the plots\n\nWhich of these plots (if any) do you think makes a better job at allowing for the comparison of the distributions across treatment groups? Why?\n\n> # I think that the fifth plot (bar chart with four columns) allows for the best comparison of the distributions across treatment groups.The columns are all of the same proportion and this makes it easy to cross examine the various distrubtions without proportional bias. Although there may have been varying amounts of each group, this graph allows for the specfic distribution comparison. The color system and layout of the graph, with race on the x-axis allows for easier visualization also. \n\n\n### 5.2: Improve the plots\n\nSelect the plot(s) that you think are the most useful for our purpose.

You can use the `write_rds` command from `readr`.
