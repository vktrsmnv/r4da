I present a field experiment demonstrating that black politicians are more intrinsically motivated to advance blacks' interests than are their counterparts. Guided by elite interviews, I emailed 6,928 U.S. state legislators from a putatively black alias asking for help signing up for state unemployment benefits. Crucially, I varied the legislators' political incentive to respond by randomizing whether the sender purported to live within or far from each legislator's district. While nonblack legislators were markedly less likely to respond when their political incentives to do so were diminished, black legislators typically continued to respond even when doing so promised little political reward. Black legislators thus appear substantially more intrinsically motivated to advance blacks' interests. As political decision making is often difficult for voters to observe, intrinsically motivated descriptive representatives play a crucial role in advancing minorities' political interests.\n\n\n| Variable            | Description                                                 |\n|:---------------|------------------------------------------|\n| `leg_black`         | Legislator receiving email is Black                         |\n| `treat_out`         | Email is from out-of-district                               |\n| `responded`         | Legislator responded to email                               |\n| `totalpop`          | District population                                         |\n| `medianhhincom`     | District median household income                            |\n| `black_medianhh`    | District median household income among Black people         |\n| `white_medianhh`    | District median household income among White people         |\n| `blackpercent`      | Percentage of district that is Black                        |\n| `statessquireindex` | State's Squire index                                        |\n| `nonblacknonwhite`  | Legislator receiving email is neither Black nor White       |\n| `urbanpercent`      | Percentage of district that is urban                        |\n| `leg_senator`       | Legislator receiving email is a senator                     |\n| `leg_democrat`      | Legislator receiving email is in the Democratic party       |\n| `south`             | Legislator receiving email is in the Southern United States |\n\n\n## Task 1: DAG \n\n> Normally in (field) experiments, the variable(s)  manipulated/randomized by researchers is(are) called the *treatment* variable(s). Here, we will be referring to treatment variables in the context of matching, i.e. the predictor that is not randomly distributed but for which we would like to mimic the randomization. In other words, the variables which we are matching on. \n\nBelow you can find a DAG that depicts the relationship between the \"treatment\" variable, `leg_black`, and the `responded`, the outcome variable as well as number of confounders to this relationship. \nThe field experiment, however, included sending emails to legislators, randomizing between the messages from in- and out-of-district. Add this variable to the DAG. You can adapt the DAG below or add the one made with `daggify.net`. \n\n\n```{dot}\n//| echo: false\n//| fig-width: 6\n//| fig-height: 4\n//| out-width: 100%\ndigraph D {\n  node [shape=oval];\n  edge [len = 1.2, arrowhead = vee];\n  a [label = \"Black Legislator\"];\n  b [label = \"Response to Email\"];\n  c [label = \"District Median Income\"];\n  d [label = \"District % Black\"];\n  e [label = \"Democrat\"];\n  f [label = \"Out-of-district Email\"]\n  \n  {rank=same a b};\n  {rank=same d c e};\n  {rank=sink f};\n  a->b;\n  c->a;\n  c->b;\n  d->a;\n  d->b;\n  e->a;\n  e->b;\n  f->b;\n}\n```\n\n\n> The fact that email was in/out-of-district was randomly assigned by the researcher, so it does not open any backdoors. \n\n\n## Task 2: Explore the Dataset \n\n1.

This is evident from all types of plots, although bar plots give us exact numbers, unlike the raw data ones. As for the randomized treatment, *in- vs. out-of-district email*, stacked bar plots show us clearly that experimental treatment groups were of equal sizes. Coming to the response rates, we can spot that for both black and non-black legislators, the response to in-district email was more likely in comparison to an out-of-district email. However, for black legislators the difference in the response rate between treatment conditions seems to be smaller than for non-black legislators. \n\n\n2. Run a linear regression model to explore if black legislators are more likely to respond to emails from out-of-district vs. in-district ones in comparison to non-black legislators. Control for the legislator party, senator status, South, and other available sociodemographic characteristics for the districts. You can print out the output with `summary()` for this task. \nComment on the findings: \n- How responsive were legislators when their political incentives were decreased?\n- How did the effect of decreasing legislators’ political incentives vary between legislators of different race?  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm1 <- lm(\n  responded ~ leg_black * treat_out + nonblacknonwhite +  black_medianhh +\n    white_medianhh + statessquireindex +  totalpop + urbanpercent +\n    medianhhincom + blackpercent + leg_democrat,\n  data = black_politicians\n)\nsummary(m1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = responded ~ leg_black * treat_out + nonblacknonwhite + \n    black_medianhh + white_medianhh + statessquireindex + totalpop + \n    urbanpercent + medianhhincom + blackpercent + leg_democrat, \n    data = black_politicians)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-0.7482 -0.3711 -0.2445  0.4566  0.8726 \n\nCoefficients:\n                      Estimate Std.

Technically, the positive sign of the interaction term showed us that the negative effect of treatment was mitigated by race to a certain extent.   \n\n3. Why could the non-random distribution of race variable be problematic for the analysis? How does matching address this issue? \n\n> The race of the elected candidate is not randomly distributed across districts. The fact that many nonblack legislators represent districts where blacks would be unlikely to get elected and/or would be unlikely to run thus constitutes a selection bias. Legislators from districts with modest black representation might have been suspicious of a letter from a putatively black individual or less knowledgeable about unemployment benefits, hence making them less likely to respond to such an email. Matching potentially removes this variation between districts by ensuring that the districts are comparable to one another based on a set of matching variables. Ideally, these matching variables should account for potential differences in response rates. \n\n\n## Task 3: Exact Matching \n\n\n1. When using matching for preprocessing, we need to disregard the dependent variable, thus we will only be working with treatment and matching variables at this stage. Look at the plot below, which shows the data across all three matching variables and points are colored by the values of the treatment variable. What do you observe regarding the distribution of the treatment variable `leg_black` across the three matching variables? \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10-problem-set_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> There are many more blacks among Democratic in comparison to Republican legislators. We are also much more likely to see a black candidate where the share of black legislators is higher, and median household income is lower. We can also see that there are many cases where for a combination of matching variables, only districts with one kind of race exist. This shows that there is some overlap between the joint distributions of the variables, but the common support is not very large. Hence finding, say, an exact match would not be easy.  \n\n2. Apply the exact matching algorithm to the dataset, and match based on the values of legislator race variable. Store the dataset in `exact_df` object. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# matchit object \nexact <-\n  matchit(\n    leg_black ~ medianhhincom + blackpercent + leg_democrat,\n    data = black_politicians %>% \n      arrange(blackpercent),\n    method = \"exact\"\n  )\n\n# resulting dataset \nexact_df <- exact %>% match.data()\n```\n:::\n\n\n3. Explore the visualized distribution over matching variables for the matched dataset. The size of the points represents the ratio between the number of treated units to untreated ones within each unique combination of values, subgroup. \nWhat do you observe from this plot: \n- what changes in the distribution of the variables in comparison to the raw data? \n- to what extent do the distributions within treated and untreated groups overlap, in comparison to raw data? \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nggplot(\n  exact_df %>%\n    group_by(subclass) %>%\n    mutate(n = if_else(\n      leg_black == 1,\n      1,\n      sum(leg_black == 1) / sum(leg_black == 0)\n    ),\n    leg_black = if_else(leg_black == 1, \"Black\", \"Non-black\") %>% as_factor()) %>%\n    arrange(leg_black, n),\n  aes(\n    medianhhincom,\n    blackpercent,\n    fill = factor(leg_black),\n    size = n\n  )\n) +\n  geom_jitter(\n    alpha = 0.7,\n    pch = 21,\n    color = \"grey80\",\n    width = 0.1,\n    height = 0.01\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(end = 0.8) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(leg_party)) +\n  labs(\n    fill = \"Legislator Race\",\n    size = \"Units in Subgroup\",\n    y = \"Share of Black Voters in District\",\n    x = \"Median Household Income in District\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.box = \"vertical\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10-problem-set_files/figure-html/exact-matching-plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> By definition of the procedure, we are looking for exact matches for combinations of matching variables between treated and untreated units (`geom_jitter` adds a bit of random noise to help with overlap), hence there is perfect overlap between the distributions. In comparison to raw data, we also have much fewer points. There are no exact matches for Republican legislators, but among Democrats, we could find 68 observations: 27 of them are black and 41 are non-black. For some combinations of matching variables, there was more than one matched non-black legislator per one black legislator. On the plot, these are subgroups with a big purple point and a a few smaller green ones. Also, sometimes there were multiple black legislators with the same combination of values in matching variables matched to one non-black legislator. On the plot, these are subgroups with bigger green points and few green ones.\n\n4. What can you say about the covariate balance in this matched dataset? Construct the covariate balance plot if you need to answer this question. \n\n> By definition of the procedure, covariate balance is perfect in this case, as the observations match perfectly on the values of matching variables. \n\n## Task 4: Nearest Neghbor Matching \n\n1. Let's try out a different matching algorithm: nearest neighbor matching with Mahalanobis distance. In a few sentences, explain what is the logic underlying this matching algorithm.\n\n> Unlike exact matching, this approach quantifies the differences between observations in terms of distance estimated based on the values of matching variables. There are different distance measures one can use, but the Mahalanobis distance accounts for the correlation in the data and allows it to, in essence, not match on highly correlated variables more than once. \n> Computationally, the algorithm does the following:  A distance is computed between each treated unit and each control unit, and, one by one, each treated unit is assigned a control unit as a match. When matching without replacement, the matched untreated unit can no longer be matched to other observations. The matching is thus \"greedy\" in the sense that there is no action taken to optimize an overall criterion; each match is selected without considering the other matches that may occur subsequently. It is thus fast but sensitive to the order of samples (unless sampled with replacement, in which case more than one control observation can be matched to a treated unit). Optimal matching, another type of matching, on the other hand, minimizes the *total* distance across all pairs, not individual distances, but it also takes longer to work.\n\n\n2. Now implement the algorithm. Explore if the ordering of observations makes a difference when you match *without* replacement. Compare the original order vs. order by `blackpercent` (`arrange()` function can help). Compare the resulting datasets with `setdiff()` or `intersect()`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# matchit object \nnearest <-\n  matchit(\n    leg_black ~ medianhhincom + blackpercent + leg_democrat,\n    data = black_politicians,\n    method = \"nearest\",\n    distance = \"mahalanobis\", replace = F\n  )\n\nnearest_ordered <-\n  matchit(\n    leg_black ~ medianhhincom + blackpercent + leg_democrat,\n    data = black_politicians %>% \n      arrange(blackpercent),\n    method = \"nearest\",\n    distance = \"mahalanobis\", replace = F\n  )\n\n# resulting dataset \nnearest_df <- nearest %>% match.data()\nnearest_ordered_df <- nearest_ordered %>% match.data()\n\n# compare datasets \n# nrow() of rows in nearest_df but not in nearest_ordered_df\nsetdiff(nearest_df %>% select(-subclass),\n        nearest_ordered_df %>% select(-subclass)) %>% nrow()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 19\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# nrow() of rows in nearest_df but not in nearest_ordered_df and vica versa\nsymdiff(nearest_ordered_df %>% select(-subclass),\n        nearest_df %>% select(-subclass)) %>% nrow()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 37\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# nrow() of rows in both nearest_df and nearest_ordered_df\nintersect(nearest_df %>% select(-subclass),\n          nearest_ordered_df %>% select(-subclass)) %>% nrow()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 705\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlove.plot(nearest) + labs(title = \"Original Order\") +\n  love.plot(nearest_ordered)  + labs(title = \"Ordered by Race\") +\n  plot_annotation(title = \"Covariate Balance\") +\n  plot_layout(guides = \"collect\") & \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Standardized mean differences and raw mean differences are present in the same plot. \nUse the `stars` argument to distinguish between them and appropriately label the x-axis.\nStandardized mean differences and raw mean differences are present in the same plot. \nUse the `stars` argument to distinguish between them and appropriately label the x-axis.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10-problem-set_files/figure-html/nnm-order-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> Because of the order of observations, the datasets differ to some extent.

There are 705 observations present in both datasets.   \n\n3. What does covariate balance mean in the context of matching? Which variables would we use to assess covariate balance? E.g., do we need to access balance for main dependent variable, treatment (the variable we used to match on), the matching variables, other variables in the dataset? Why (not)? \n\n> Covariate balance is the degree to which the distribution of matching variables is similar across values of the treatment. Balance is a way to assess the quality of the resulting matches. When covariate balance is achieved, the resulting effect estimate is less sensitive to model misspecification and ideally close to the true treatment effect.

For in-district emails, black legislators have a lower probability to respond (-0.2095 on average, plot *FD: in, black vs. non-black*).

Based on this code, you can do the coarsened exact matching and explore how the cut-offs used for coarsening impact the outcomes. \n\n### Exact Matching\n\nLet's start with exact matching. You can find the code in the chunk below. Here is what we do step-by-step:\n\n- We use `group_by()` to create groups with every unique combination of matching variables. In this case, we are using `blackpercent`, `medianhhincom`, `leg_democrat` as our matching variables. \n- We then create new variables: \n  - `n` is the size of the group, i.e. how many observations have that unique combination in matching variables\n  - `treated_in_group` counts the number of treated units within each group \n  - `untreated_in_group` counts the number of untreated units within each group\n- Next, we move on and remove the groups, subclasses, that have only one observation in them (i.e. cases where there are no matches found at all). We also remove the groups that contain only the treated units and only untreated units as they also did not match the treated units to untreated ones. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmanual_exact_df <- black_politicians %>%\n  group_by(blackpercent, medianhhincom, leg_party) %>%\n  mutate(\n    group_id = cur_group_id(),\n    n = n(),\n    treated_in_group = sum(leg_black),\n    untreated_in_group = sum(leg_black == 0)\n  ) %>%\n  filter(\n    n > 1,\n    untreated_in_group > 0,\n    treated_in_group > 0\n  )\n\n# check ourselves with the package\nexact_df <-\n  matchit(\n    leg_black ~ medianhhincom + blackpercent + leg_party,\n    data = black_politicians,\n    method = \"exact\",\n  ) %>%\n  match.data()\n\n# compare the datasets (only the first 14 columns with actual data)\nsetdiff(manual_exact_df[, 1:14], exact_df[, 1:14])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 0 × 14\n# Groups:   blackpercent, medianhhincom [0]\n# ℹ 14 variables: leg_black <dbl>, treat_out <dbl>, responded <dbl>,\n#   totalpop <dbl>, medianhhincom <dbl>, black_medianhh <dbl>,\n#   white_medianhh <dbl>, blackpercent <dbl>, statessquireindex <dbl>,\n#   nonblacknonwhite <dbl>, urbanpercent <dbl>, leg_senator <dbl>,\n#   leg_democrat <dbl>, south <dbl>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRecall that we are trying to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated, so to compare the actual outcome of the dependent variable, responding to email, given that the *treatment* was administered (i.e. the legislator was black) to the *counterfactual*, i.e. the hypothetical situation of the legislator in that same district not being black. This means that we want to have the situation of just one matched untreated unit per every treated unit. Let's see if it is the case:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmanual_exact_df %>%\n  reframe(ratio_in_group = treated_in_group / untreated_in_group) %>%\n  distinct() %>%\n  pull(ratio_in_group) %>%\n  table()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n.\n0.333333333333333               0.5 0.666666666666667                 1 \n                6                 6                 1                 4 \n                2                 3 \n                3                 1 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we see, the ratio is equal only in 4 subgroups. In 6 groups, we have 3 treated per one treated, while in 1 subgroup, we have 3 treated vs. 1 untreated units (0.33 ratio). In order to balance out our observations within groups to the 1:1 ratio, we need to \"upweight\" the untreated units when $n_{untreated} < n_{treated}$ within a subgroup and \"downweight\" them if $n_{untreated} > n_{treated}$. This way, we would obtain the difference in means for the outcome variable within the subgroup. Thus we need to weigh the untreated units with this ratio: \n\n$$\nw^{untreated}_{subgroup} = \\frac{n_{treated}}{n_{untreated}}, ~\\text{ and }~w^{treated}_{subgroup} = 1\n$$\n\nIn addition to the part of the weights that equals out the relative shares of treated vs. untreated units, we want normalize these weights so that their sum equals the number of observations in the matched dataset. This is important for calculating the standard errors. Hence we additionally add the ratio of $N_{untreated}/N_{treated}$ for the complete matched dataset (not within each subgroup as before). The weights then become:\n\n$$\nw^{untreated} = \\frac{N_{untreated}}{N_{treated}}\\times \\frac{n_{treated}}{n_{untreated}}, ~\\text{ and }~w^{treated} = 1\n$$\n\nThis is the manual implementation in `R`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmanual_exact_df <- manual_exact_df %>%\n  mutate(ratio_in_group = treated_in_group / untreated_in_group) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(\n    ratio_total = sum(leg_black == 0) / sum(leg_black == 1),\n    weights = (ratio_total * ratio_in_group),\n    weights = if_else(leg_black == 1, 1, weights)\n  )\n\n# check with package\ncbind(\n  \"Manual\" = manual_exact_df$weights %>% table(),\n  \"MatchIt\" = exact_df$weights %>% table()\n) %>%\n  kable(digits = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|                  | Manual| MatchIt|\n|:-----------------|------:|-------:|\n|0.506172839506173 |     18|      18|\n|0.759259259259259 |     12|      12|\n|1                 |     27|      27|\n|1.01234567901235  |      3|       3|\n|1.51851851851852  |      4|       4|\n|3.03703703703704  |      3|       3|\n|4.55555555555556  |      1|       1|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we can proceed to the estimation step (with a simplified model): \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# same with linear regression\nm1 <- lm(responded ~ leg_black, exact_df, weights = weights)\nsummary(m1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = responded ~ leg_black, data = exact_df, weights = weights)\n\nWeighted Residuals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-0.9750 -0.4074 -0.3250  0.4916  0.9467 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Recall that we need to split the continuous variables into a number of bins to reduce the dimensionality. You can use `cut()` function to make such bins:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncut(black_politicians$blackpercent, breaks = 5) %>%\n  table() %>%\n  kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|.                 | Freq|\n|:-----------------|----:|\n|(-0.000673,0.195] | 4799|\n|(0.195,0.39]      |  432|\n|(0.39,0.585]      |  178|\n|(0.585,0.78]      |  161|\n|(0.78,0.975]      |   23|\n:::\n:::\n\n\n1. Adjust the code below to create such binned versions of the variables. Split `blackpercent` into 10 bins and `medianhhincom` into 12 (these are arbitrary values). Note that `leg_democrat` is categorical, so you don't need to split it. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmanual_cem_df <- black_politicians %>%\n mutate(\n   medianhhincom_coarse = cut(medianhhincom, breaks = 12),\n   blackpercent_coarse = cut(blackpercent, breaks = 10),\n  ) %>% \n  group_by(blackpercent_coarse, medianhhincom_coarse, leg_party) %>%\n  mutate(\n    subclass = cur_group_id(),\n    n = n(),\n    treated_in_group = sum(leg_black),\n    untreated_in_group = sum(leg_black == 0)\n  ) %>%\n  filter(\n    n > 1,\n    untreated_in_group > 0,\n    treated_in_group > 0\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(ratio_in_group = treated_in_group / untreated_in_group) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(\n    ratio_total = sum(leg_black == 0) / sum(leg_black == 1),\n    weights = (ratio_total * ratio_in_group),\n    weights = if_else(leg_black == 1, 1, weights)\n  )\n\n# quick & dirty plots to assess the balance\n# note that we need to apply weights, too!\nblackpercent <- ggplot(\n  manual_cem_df,\n  aes(\n    x = blackpercent,\n    color = factor(leg_black),\n    group = factor(leg_black)\n  )\n) +\n  geom_density(aes(weight = weights))\n\nmedianhhincom <- ggplot(\n  manual_cem_df,\n  aes(\n    x = medianhhincom,\n    color = factor(leg_black),\n    group = factor(leg_black)\n  )\n) +\n  geom_density(aes(weight = weights))\n\nleg_democrat <- ggplot(\n  manual_cem_df,\n  aes(\n    x = leg_democrat,\n    color = factor(leg_black),\n    group = factor(leg_black)\n  )\n) +\n  geom_density(aes(weight = weights))\n\n# plot all conditional distributions\nleg_democrat / blackpercent / medianhhincom\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10-problem-set_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2.

Comment on the plot generated from your matched dataset. How does the ratio between treated and untreated units seem to look across the variables? What are the differences to exact matching? \n\n> In comparison to exact matching, there are many more than one untreated units per treated unit. Tthis ratio increases the more the subgroups we create (10 $\\times$ 12 $\\times 2 gave us 240 subgroups, the somewhat better option of 15 $\\times$ 15 $\\times 2 gave us 450 subgroups). We are thus seeing the trade-off between the number of matched units vs. the potential bias in the resuts due to imperfect matches. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(\n  manual_cem_df %>%\n    group_by(subclass) %>%\n    mutate(n = if_else(\n      leg_black == 1,\n      1,\n      sum(leg_black == 1) / sum(leg_black == 0)\n    )) %>%\n    arrange(leg_black, n),\n  aes(\n    medianhhincom,\n    blackpercent,\n    fill = factor(leg_black),\n    size = n\n  )\n) +\n  geom_point(\n    alpha = 0.7,\n    pch = 21,\n    color = \"grey80\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(end = 0.8) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(leg_party)) +\n  labs(\n    fill = \"Treatment Variable (Legislator is Black)\",\n    size = \"Units in Subgroup\",\n    y = \"Share of Black Voters in District\",\n    x = \"Median Household Income in District\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.box = \"vertical\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10-problem-set_files/figure-html/cem-manual-plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
