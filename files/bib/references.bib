    abstract = { Posttreatment variables are covariates that are preceded by the main explanatory variable. Their inclusion in a statistical model does not ‘control’ for their influence on the relationship of interest, and it does not substitute for a mediation analysis. Likewise, a coefficient estimate of an appropriate ‘control variable’ cannot be interpreted as a causal effect estimate. While these facts are well-established in various fields across the social sciences, their recognition in the field of peace and conflict studies is more limited. Originally collected data on recent publications from leading peace and conflict journals reveal that a large majority of evaluated articles condition on posttreatment variables, demonstrating how a review of these fallacies can help to substantially improve future research on peace and conflict. Drawing on a broad set of literature and using graphical approaches, I offer an intuitive explanation of the logic of posttreatment variables and clarify common misconceptions. Building on recent developments in methodology and software, and by deriving conditions for bounding using analytical bias expressions, I discuss avenues for dealing with posttreatment variables in observational studies. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for applied research. }

abstract = {Abstract We use plausibly exogenous variation in the availability of the Russian analog television signal in Ukraine to study how a media source with a conspicuous political agenda impacts political behavior and attitudes. Using highly disaggregated election data and an original survey, we estimate that Russian television substantially increased average electoral support for parties and candidates with a “pro-Russian” agenda in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. Evidence suggests that this effect is attributable to persuasion rather than differential mobilization. The effectiveness of biased media varied in a politically consequential way: Its impact was largest on voters with strong pro-Russian priors but was less effective, and to some degree even counter-effective, in persuading those with strong pro-Western priors. Our finding suggests that exposing an already polarized society to a biased media source can result in even deeper polarization.},

abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an explosion on the computational power and a parallel increase of the access to large sets of data – the so called Big Data paradigm – which is enabling to develop brand new quantitative strategies underpinning description, understanding and control of complex scenarios. One interesting area of application concerns fraud detection from online data, and more particularly extracting meaningful information from massive digital fingerprints of electoral activity to detect, a posteriori, evidence of fraudulent behavior. In this short article we discuss a few quantitative methodologies that have emerged in recent years on this respect, which altogether form the nascent interdisciplinary field of election forensics. Aiming to foster discussion and raise awareness on this interdisciplinary area, we hereby enumerate a few of the most relevant approaches and methods.}

abstract = {Democratic societies are built around the principle of free and fair elections, and that each citizen’s vote should count equally. National elections can be regarded as large-scale social experiments, where people are grouped into usually large numbers of electoral districts and vote according to their preferences. The large number of samples implies statistical consequences for the polling results, which can be used to identify election irregularities. Using a suitable data representation, we find that vote distributions of elections with alleged fraud show a kurtosis substantially exceeding the kurtosis of normal elections, depending on the level of data aggregation. As an example, we show that reported irregularities in recent Russian elections are, indeed, well-explained by systematic ballot stuffing. We develop a parametric model quantifying the extent to which fraudulent mechanisms are present. We formulate a parametric test detecting these statistical properties in election results. Remarkably, this technique produces robust outcomes with respect to the resolution of the data and therefore, allows for cross-country comparisons.}}

abstract = {We develop a statistical method for testing whether election results show irregularities that are consistent with voter rigging. Nowadays, a large number of countries combine formal democratic institutions with authoritarian practices. Although in these countries the ruling elites may receive considerable voter support, they often use several manipulation tools to control election outcomes. A common practice of these regimes is the coercion and mobilization of large numbers of voters. This electoral irregularity is known as voter rigging, distinguishing it from vote rigging, which involves ballot stuffing or stealing. We develop a statistical test to quantify the extent to which the results of a particular election display traces of voter rigging. Our key hypothesis is that small polling stations are more susceptible to voter rigging because it is easier to identify opposing individuals, there are fewer eyewitnesses, and interested parties might reasonably expect fewer visits from election observers. We devise a general statistical method for testing whether voting behavior in small polling stations is significantly different from the behavior in their neighbor stations in a way that is consistent with the widespread occurrence of voter rigging. On the basis of a comparative analysis, the method enables third parties to conclude that an explanation other than simple variability is needed to explain geographic heterogeneities in vote preferences. We analyze 21 elections in 10 countries and find significant statistical anomalies compatible with voter rigging in Russia from 2007 to 2011, in Venezuela from 2006 to 2013, and in Uganda in 2011. Particularly disturbing is the case of Venezuela, where the smallest polling stations were decisive to the outcome of the 2013 presidential elections.}}
