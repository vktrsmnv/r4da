This time we are talking about the ways to communicate uncertainty about the estimates with the concepts of standard errors and confidence intervals. We also revisit hypothesis testing with p-values. 

## Required readings

- {{< fa book >}} [Chapter 13 in *The Effect*](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-StatisticalAdjustment.html) [@Huntington-Klein:2021]

### Guiding questions:

- What is uncertainty in statistics? Where does (estimation) uncertainty come from? 
- What is a sampling distribution of a statistic? How is it generated? What is the shape of a sampling distribution? 
- What is a standard error? How is it related to the concept of confidence interval? 
- Why are there different confidence levels in confidence intervals? What are the trade-offs associated with reporting a larger interval vs. smaller interval?
