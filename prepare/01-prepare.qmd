## Software

In this course, we will use the open-source software `R` and RStudio as well as version control with `git` and GitHub. It would be best if you try installing all the necessary software *before* our class on Tuesday. First, I would like you to install both `R` and RStudio on your computer. Then, move to `git` and GitHub. This may look like a lot, but all of these tools will simplify your workflow once you actually start coding in R. 

Please follow these [instructions for Installing R, RStudio, git, and Connecting to GitHub](/resource/install.html). 

If everything works wellâ€“congrats, you are all set for the semester! If something doesn't work---don't worry, just talk to me before or after class and we'll figure it out together on Tuesday. You are also welcome to use the Cloud version Rstudio for the first two weeks or so, but you will have to switch to the desktop versions eventually.
