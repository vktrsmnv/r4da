This week, we will move to what's called 'selection on unobservables", which is way of controlling for all variables, whether theyâ€™re observed or not. *Fixed effects* allows us to do so as long as all these variables stay constant within some larger category.

## Required readings

- {{< fa book >}} [Chapter 16 in *The Effect*](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-FixedEffects.html) [@Huntington-Klein:2021]
